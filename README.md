## API Endpoints

There are 2 endpoints of the API

1. Through mongoDB's compass (dev)
2. Through the cloud, Atlas of mongoDB (test)

(I used the dev path)

You can change the API path by changing the path in the .ENV file

## Authentication

The TOKEN is created when an existing user logs in
It contains the email and encrypted password of the logged in user
When verifying a request, add the TOKEN at the top of the request
